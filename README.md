# Volatility Prediction 

# Choice of Dataset
* Implied volatility derived from options prices serves as a forward-looking estimate of future volatility, often outperforming historical measures in forecasting realized volatility.
* Numerous studies confirm that option-implied volatility (IV) captures market expectations and news-related information, enabling effective predictions of subsequent price swings.
* Hence we'll use options data to predict the implied volatility instead of using historic/realised volatility.
